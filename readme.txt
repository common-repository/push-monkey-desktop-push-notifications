The most direct way to engage with your readers on Chrome, Safari and Firefox by sending web push notifications directly to their desktops; with clear stats and seamless integration.

Remind your shopers about abandoned carts with our WooCommerce integration.

== Description ==

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2w4FAXPvAk

Send push notifications directly to your readers’ mobiles and desktops when new content is fresh from the oven.

= Why Push Monkey? =

= Increased Engagement =

Readers can be informed about your content at all times: when reading other websites or while working in other apps, with the browser closed. Even when the computer is not active - it displays all missed notifications the moment it wakes up. For Chrome, notifications can also include an image.

= Native =

Your readers don't have to install any additional apps or plugins. They just accept receiving notifications from your website and presto!

= Granular Filtering =

Easily decide and control for what type of content to send out notifications. Filter by custom post type and by category for standard posts. No content clutter around here!

= Segmentation & Geolocation =

Define segments of interest for your subscribers. This will allow you to know what your subscribers are interested in and where they are from so you can provide relevant notifications.

= Automatic =

By default, push notifications are sent automatically when you publish a new post. This workflow doesn't sound cool? No worries, we have a more granular filtering and custom push notifications.

= Statistics =

The plugin provides essential usage and engagement data available directly in your Wordpress dashboard so you can create the best experience for your subscribers.

= Super fast setup. Zero coding required =

Fast and easy to set up and no coding or API configuration required. The monkeys do all the pushing so you can focus on your content and readers.

= WooCommerce Integration =

Remind your visitors about abandoned carts with our WooCommerce integration.

= No Monkey Business =

Sending notifications on a big and reliable scale is not trivial, but our solid high-availability cloud back-end has already delivered millions of notifications...and it's not stopping here.

**NOTE:**
Currently for Chrome 43 and above, Safari from OS X Mavericks (and newer) and Firefox 44 and above, Windows, MacOS and Android.

This plugin connects the WordPress API with the Push Monkey server (getpushmonkey.com) - server which actually delivers the notifications. An FREE account on getpushmonkey.com is required, no credit card needed. Don't worry, you can setup an account faster than you can say ba-na-na.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.5 or greater
* PHP version 5.6 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater
* Permalinks enabled

1. Upload the Push Monkey plugin to your blog (Or install it via the "Add New Plugin" option in your WordPress dashboard)

2. Activate it

3. Sign in with your Push Monkey account or create a new account. More info at: [Push Monkey](https://www.getpushmonkey.com?source=readme).

4. Tell your readers about it :)

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work without any problems; If you do encounter any problems, please [let us know](https://www.getpushmonkey.com/#contact?source=readme).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Push Monkey Free? =
Yes! All the Push Monkey features are free and you don't need to pay until you reach a certain readership. At the moment, once you pass 100 subscribers, we would recommend upgrading to a payed tier. If not, you can still use Push Monkey, just no new subscribers will be registered.

= Should I purchase a paid plan? ==
Only if the number of subscribers grows drastically.

= I've installed the plugin, but something doesn't seem to work =
Pop us an email, write us a message on [getpushmonkey.com](getpushmonkey.com) or on live chat. We're always happy to help.
